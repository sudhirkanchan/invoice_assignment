#Invoice Assignme**nt
A JavaScript application for an Invoice page, created with basic datasets using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project primarily focuses on functionality.

HTML Table Creation: Uses JavaScript DOM API to dynamically load and display invoice items in an HTML table.

Pagination: Displays 7 items per page initially, with Next and Previous buttons for navigation.

Sorting Functionality: Allows sorting of table columns in both ascending and descending order.

Checkbox Selection: Includes checkboxes to select or deselect individual items or all invoice items at once.

Note: No backend API is integrated; datasets are hardcoded within the JavaScript file. In the absence of an exact UX design, CSS styles and icons are applied based on general assumptions.

#Running the Application
This is a Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application. Simply open the index.html file in a browser to run the application.
